Welcome to the KnockOffGWAS pipeline webpage!
=============================================

The main purpose of this website is to provide a practical step-by-step guide to performing `KnockOff GWAS <https://msesia.github.io/knockoffgwas/index.html>` on a genetic dataset as described by Sesia et al. :cite:`sesia:etal:2021`. This will take the form of following a real data analysis using the pipeline. Crucially, the pipeline includes everything that is necessary to perform the analysis starting with your genetic data. This takes the form of generic scripts that can be used with any data which includes all intermediate steps to create and convert data where necessary.
